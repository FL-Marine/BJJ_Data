## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
bjjdata <- read.csv("~/R Projects/BJJ_Data/BJJ_R data - Copy.csv")
View(bjjdata)

```

# test
```{r}
ggplot(data = bjjdata, mapping = aes(x = offense_succeeded)) + geom_bar()
```
